# This is test script for check HCS logs and show statistics of the data

main3.py - this script could count HIT/MISS and total chunks+manifest requests for differnt services. 

main-mp-prod.py - this script for multiprocessing counting (suggest no more than 4 cpu). It could count vMOS and HIT-MISS statistics for chunks only and don't show independent HLSv3
